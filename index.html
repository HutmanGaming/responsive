    My name is Brandon Wallin, I am a 20 year old adult male. I was born in Oregon but have lived most my life in Texas. I am learning to code in order to begin a career for myself and create a bright future for me. My hobbies involve playing games, working on my Minecraft server, talking to friends, and watching informational videos. I do not currently have much experience in coding, but I do have a few years of experience in configuration so reading large piles of text and deciphering what it means isn't so far fetched.
